\subsection{ISO/SAE 21434: Overview}\label{subsec:iso-sae-21434}

The ISO/SAE 21434 standard is a joint standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) to address the cybersecurity of road vehicles.
The standard is designed to provide a framework for the development of secure vehicles and their components.
The standard covers the entire lifecycle of a vehicle, from design and development to production and operation.
It provides guidelines for identifying and assessing cybersecurity risks, as well as for implementing security measures to mitigate those risks.
The standard also includes requirements for monitoring and responding to cybersecurity incidents, as well as for managing the security of vehicle components and systems.
The ISO/SAE 21434 standard is intended to be used by vehicle manufacturers,
suppliers, and other stakeholders in the automotive industry to improve the cybersecurity of vehicles and protect them from cyber threats\cite{iso-correlation}.

\textbf{ISO/SAE 21434} is the international standard designed to address cybersecurity in road vehicles, particularly focusing on electrical and electronic (E/E) systems.
Released in August 2021, this standard establishes guidelines for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and suppliers to manage cybersecurity risks throughout the entire lifecycle of vehicle systems.
Moreover, it introduces the concept of Cybersecurity Assurance Levels, which categorize the severity of cybersecurity threats and the corresponding measures to mitigate them\cite{moukahal2021towards}.

\subsubsection{Conclusion}\label{subsubsec:conclusion}

ISO/SAE 21434 aims to enhance the cybersecurity posture of the automotive industry by establishing a comprehensive framework for managing risks associated with E/E systems in vehicles.
While it addresses critical aspects of cybersecurity, its limitations, particularly the lack of prescribed technical solutions and mandatory compliance, highlight the need for continued development and adaptation to effectively mitigate evolving cybersecurity threats.

\subsection{UNECE WP.29: Overview}\label{subsec:unece-wp-29}

The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) oversees regulations concerning cybersecurity and software updates for road vehicles, specifically through the UNECE WP.29 framework.

\subsubsection{Key Points}\label{subsubsec:key-points}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Cybersecurity Regulations (R155)}: Established in March 2021, these regulations are crucial for OEMs and Tier suppliers in UNECE member countries.
    Compliance is mandatory for new vehicle types since July 2022 and for all vehicles from July 2024.
    \item \textbf{Components of R155}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS)}: Organizations must implement a CSMS to manage cyber risks across the vehicle lifecycle.
        This systematic approach involves defining processes, responsibilities, and governance to protect vehicles from cyber threats.
        \item \textbf{Certification}: OEMs must apply for a Certificate of Compliance for their CSMS, which is valid for three years, subject to renewal.
        The approval process involves assessments and validation by technical services and Approval Authorities.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Threats and Mitigations in R155}\label{subsubsec:threats-and-mitigations-in-r155}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Annex 5 Structure}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Part A}: Identifies 32 potential threats related to various attack surfaces (e.g., communication channels, back-end servers).
        Each threat includes examples of vulnerabilities affecting Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of vehicle systems.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Confidentiality Threats}: For example, eavesdropping on communications.
            \item \textbf{Integrity Threats}: Unauthorized manipulation or deletion of vehicle data.
            \item \textbf{Availability Threats}: Risks such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks that may compromise user safety.
        \end{enumerate}

        \item \textbf{Part B}: Outlines high-level mitigation actions specifically for vehicle-related threats.
        For instance, to protect confidential data in transit, one suggested mitigation is to ensure that all confidential communications are safeguarded, although it does not detail specific implementations.

        \item \textbf{Part C}: Addresses threats from external entities, such as back-end servers.
        It recommends measures like applying security checks and adhering to OWASP guidelines to prevent unauthorized access.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Overall, the UNECE regulations emphasize a comprehensive and systematic approach to cybersecurity in the automotive sector, requiring OEMs to be proactive in identifying risks and implementing suitable mitigations.

    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Conclusion}\label{subsubsec:conclusion2}

In conclusion, while UNECE R155 and ISO/SAE 21434 share common goals of enhancing cybersecurity in the automotive industry, they differ significantly in their nature, application, and requirements.
UNECE R155 is a binding regulation focused on approval, while ISO/SAE 21434 serves as a comprehensive standard for the entire vehicle lifecycle.
Their complementary nature allows manufacturers to leverage the documentation and processes of one to meet the requirements of the other,
fostering a more robust approach to cybersecurity in road vehicles\cite{comparison-standard}.
The problem remains that the lack of mandatory enforcement in ISO/SAE 21434 could lead to inconsistent implementation across the industry and potentially undermine the standard's effectiveness in addressing cybersecurity threats.
