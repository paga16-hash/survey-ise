\subsection{ISO/SAE 21434: Overview}\label{subsec:iso-sae-21434}

Released in August 2021, the ISO/SAE 21434 standard is a joint standard
developed by the \href{https://www.iso.org/home.html}{International Organization for Standardization (ISO)} and the
\href{https://www.sae.org/}{Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)} to address the cybersecurity of road vehicles.

The standard is designed to provide a framework for the development of secure vehicles and their components,
covering the entire lifecycle of a vehicle, from design and development to production and operation.
It provides guidelines for identifying and assessing cybersecurity risks, as well as for implementing security measures to mitigate those risks.
The standard also includes requirements for monitoring and responding to cybersecurity incidents, as well as for managing the security of vehicle components and systems.

It establishes guidelines for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and suppliers to manage cybersecurity risks introducing the concept of Cybersecurity Assurance Levels,
which categorize the severity of cybersecurity threats and the corresponding measures to mitigate them~\cite{moukahal2021towards,iso-correlation}.

Here's an overview, including key points, limitations, and guidelines.

\subsection{UNECE WP.29 R155: Overview}\label{subsec:unece-wp-29-r155}

\href{https://unece.org/}{The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)} oversees regulations concerning cybersecurity and software updates for road vehicles, specifically through the
\href{https://unece.org/wp29-introduction}{UNECE WP.29} section.
Regulation 155 (R155) was established in March 2021 to address cybersecurity threats in vehicles and ensure user safety.
It outlines requirements for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and tier suppliers to implement cybersecurity measures in new vehicles,
with compliance becoming mandatory for all vehicles by July 2024.
Since there are currently no uniform evaluation criteria at the product level, the question arises as to which development artifacts could serve as indicators to determine the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.
In response to this challenge, SAE analyzes existing security concepts in the ISO/SAE 21434 standard, providing an overview of the-state-of-the-art in security evaluation methods.
The general goal is to derive applicable evaluation criteria and recommendations for an R155 approval,
taking into account relevant security properties that help decide the sufficiency of security measures~\cite{hellstern2024cybersecurity}.

As for the ISO/SAE 21434 standard, key points, correlations, threats, and mitigations in UNECE WP.29 R155 are discussed below.

\subsubsection{Key Points}\label{subsubsec:key-points}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Cybersecurity Regulations (R155)}: Crucial regulations for OEMs and tier suppliers in UNECE member countries.
    Mandatory compliance for new vehicle types since July 2022 and for all vehicles from July 2024.
    Compliance is mandatory.
    \item \textbf{Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS)}: Organizations must implement CSMS to manage cyber risks across the vehicle lifecycle.
    This systematic approach involves defining processes, responsibilities, and governance to protect vehicles from cyber threats.
    \item \textbf{Certification}: OEMs must apply for a Certificate of Compliance for their CSMS, which is valid for three years, subject to renewal.
    The approval process involves assessments and validation by technical services and Approval Authorities.
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Structure}\label{subsubsec:structure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Part A}: Identifies 32 potential threats related to various attack surfaces.
    Each threat includes examples of vulnerabilities affecting CIA triad of vehicle systems.
    \item \textbf{Part B}: Outlines high-level mitigation actions specifically for vehicle-related threats.
    \item \textbf{Part C}: Addresses threats from external entities.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Limitations}\label{subsubsec:limitations-2}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Focus on Conventional Vehicles}: R155 was developed with traditional vehicles in mind and may not fully address the unique complexities of autonomous vehicles (AVs) with their advanced software, sensors, and connectivity.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Adaptability}: The regulation does not provide specific guidance on securing AI models, machine learning algorithms, or V2X communication, which are crucial for AVs.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Flexibility}: R155 emphasizes managing known risks but lacks the flexibility to proactively address evolving cybersecurity threats, which are rapidly changing in the AV domain.
    \item \textbf{Insufficient Supply Chain Risk Management}: The regulation lacks in addressing cybersecurity risks across complex AV supply chains, like third-party software.
