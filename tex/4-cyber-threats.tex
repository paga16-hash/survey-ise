In this section, the goal is to discuss potential threats about the two macro-areas covered by this report:
communication (specifically VANETs) and the perception system,
giving a comprehensive overview of the potential threats and the
countermeasures that can be adopted to mitigate them, focussing on remote attacks.
Since there are two crucial aspects of the AVs, the potential threats are numerous and varied.
The multitude of technologies involved in these two areas makes the AVs vulnerable to a wide range of attacks,
decreasing the threshold of security.
Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the safety and functionality of AVs, posing significant risks to passengers, pedestrians, and other road users.
Since now cars are connected to the internet, there is no need to be physically close to the car to exploit these vulnerabilities and this expands the attack surface drastically.
In the past decade (2010 onward), nearly 79.6\% of all automotive attacks have been
remote attacks\cite{cybersec}.

\subsection{General}\label{subsec:communication-system}

This section highlights various attacks, possible tempering and threats that affect the security services in general regarding
the CIA triad.
It is important to mention that the CIA triad is a model designed to guide policies for information security, and in the list below some techniques can be not present.

\paragraph{Attack on Confidentiality}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Eavesdropping}: Intercepts confidential information, such as user identity and location.
    \item \textbf{Traffic Analysis}: Analyzes message transmission patterns to extract sensitive information.
    \item \textbf{Man-in-the-Middle}: Intercepts and alters messages between communicating vehicles.
    \item \textbf{Social Engineering}: Distracts drivers with unethical messages, affecting their performance.
    \item \textbf{Sybil Attack}: Uses multiple fake identities to mislead vehicles and compromise confidentiality.
    \item \textbf{GPS Spoofing}: Creates false GPS information, compromising location confidentiality.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Attack on Data Integrity}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Masquerading}: Uses valid credentials to broadcast false messages.
    \item \textbf{Replay}: Repeats or delays transmissions, complicating emergency responses.
    \item \textbf{Message Tampering}: Modifies messages to influence driving behavior.
    \item \textbf{Illusion}: Generates misleading traffic warnings based on malicious data.
    \item \textbf{Node Impersonation}: Uses a valid user ID to impersonate another user, compromising the integrity of communications.
    \item \textbf{Key/Certificate Replication}: Uses duplicates to create confusion, affecting data authenticity and integrity.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Attack on Availability}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Denial-of-Service}: Blocks vehicle communication, disrupting operations; can occur as distributed denial of service (DDoS)\cite{sontakke2022impact}.
    \item \textbf{Jamming}: Uses strong signals to disrupt communication channels, critical for safety applications.
    \item \textbf{Malware}: Penetrates OBUs and RSUs, leading to system malfunctions.
    \item \textbf{Broadcast Tampering}: Untrustworthy vehicles alter or replicate messages, hiding critical safety information.
    \item \textbf{Black-hole}: Malicious nodes receive but do not forward packets, obstructing communication. Another version is the \textit{Gray-hole} that selectively drops only some packets.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Perception System}\label{subsec:perception-system}

The perception system in AVs is responsible for collecting and processing data from various sensors to understand the vehicle's surroundings.
The data collected by the perception system is crucial for making informed decisions and coordinating the vehicle's actuators in a safe and efficient manner.
However, since it is composed by a multitude of sensors, the perception system is a subsystem where the attack surface is huge\ref{fig:sensors-2}.
In this section, some main issues about the perception system will be presented and discussed, focusing on the potential threats and the countermeasures that can be adopted to mitigate them\cite{sensors}.

Some AVs sensors are \textit{LiDAR}, \textit{radar}, \textit{cameras}, and \textit{ultrasonic sensors}, to perceive and interpret their surroundings accurately.
For their nature, it is challenging preventing from common attacks like spoofing and jamming.
Sensor spoofing involves introducing false data into the sensor systems, while jamming overwhelms the sensors with noise, disrupting their normal functioning.

Through such manipulation, attackers can deceive the vehicle's control systems, causing misinterpretations of the environment.
For example, projecting fake obstacles might cause unnecessary braking, while concealing real obstacles could lead to collisions.
These manipulations result in erratic driving behavior.
In cases of jamming, AVs may become \textit{careless} to their surroundings, resulting in dangerous situations due to the absence of reliable sensor input\cite{durlik2022cybersecurity}.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/sensors}
    \caption{Main sensors used in AVs from \cite{sensors}}
    \label{fig:sensors-2}
\end{figure}

What emerges from the literature is that the perception system is a critical component of AVs, mainly every sensor can be a potential target for cyber-attacks using the techniques mentioned above.
From LiDAR, Ultrasonic Sensor, Camera, Radar, GPS, that are the most common sensors used is AVs, to the Tire Pressure sensors are all potential targets\cite{sensors}.


\paragraph{Countermeasures}

Given the complexity of autonomous vehicle perception systems, they can easily become a target for attacks.
The current approach acknowledges this vulnerability, which is challenging to fully eliminate.
Instead, the focus is shifting towards recognizing the stimuli detected by these systems and determining whether they are legitimate or not.
As highlighted in the Machine Learning/AI section\ref{subsec:artificial-intelligence-for-cybersecurity-in-avs}, machine learning algorithms—particularly those for anomaly detection—are being employed to identify and respond to irregularities in sensor data.
Another effective countermeasure is sensor fusion, which involves cross-referencing data from multiple sensors.
This technique helps to provide more accurate measurements and enables more stable decision-making and reactions.

However, while Machine Learning offers new avenues for detecting and mitigating these attacks, it introduces a new challenge: in the event of an error, who is held accountable for the incident?
This leads to ethical considerations, though that is not our primary focus here.

A more relevant question for us arises in the context of forensic analysis: How should we proceed when investigating an attack?
How do we detect the attack, and how can we effectively mitigate it if the anomaly was identified by a black-box algorithm?\cite{cybersecurity2022forensics}
