\subsection{Communication and Network}\label{subsec:v2x-communication-and-network}

\subsubsection{AMOEBA for location privacy}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Purpose}: Mitigates unauthorized tracking in VANETs using pseudonymization and random silent periods.
    \item \textbf{Key Features}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Divides road networks into observed and unobserved (mixing) zones.
        \item Vehicles in unobserved zones change directions, speeds, and pseudonyms to prevent tracking.
        \item Utilizes navigation groups for anonymous access to Location-Based Services (LBS).
        \item Random silent periods between pseudonym updates in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications to unlink identities.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Limitations}: The leader of the navigation group may suffer privacy loss and computational overhead due to its role in the V2I applications.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Cryptographic MIX-Zone (CMIX)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Purpose}: Protects privacy through cryptographic methods in mixing zones.
    \item \textbf{Key Features}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Road-Side Units (RSUs) provide vehicles with public and private keys.
        \item Messages are encrypted inside mixing zones, and pseudonyms are exchanged for anonymous communication.
        \item Uses Pseudonym Certification Authority (PCA) for cross-certification and pseudonym validation.
        \item Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and tamper-proof protections may be used to ensure security, though cost can be prohibitive.
        \item Rotating certificates to avoid correlation between different locations.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Challenges}: High cost of cryptographic hardware and managing cross-certification of pseudonyms.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{K-Anonymity}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Purpose}: Ensures location privacy in LBS by making a vehicleâ€™s position indistinguishable from others.
    \item \textbf{Key Features}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \emph{K} refers to the minimum number of vehicles with similar location information.
        \item Utilizes a trusted central server that anonymizes data via spatial and temporal cloaking.
        \item The anonymity level (\emph{K}) and transmission of location data are customizable by users.
        \item A node only sends location information if there are \emph{K-1} other vehicles nearby.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Advantages}: Scalable and adaptable privacy protection based on the number of vehicles in proximity.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Dynamic Change MAC/PHY}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Purpose}: Protects privacy by dynamically changing network-layer identifiers in VANETs.
    \item \textbf{Key Features}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Dynamically swaps MAC/PHY addresses on Wi-Fi networks (similar to DHCP dynamic IP addressing).
        \item Randomization of MAC/PHY addresses prevents long-term tracking by adversaries.
        \item Incorporates cryptographic key exchange to ensure security during the address swapping process.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Advantages}: Increases privacy by making it harder to track vehicles based on MAC/PHY addresses.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Density-Based Location Privacy (DLP)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Purpose}: Enhances privacy based on the density of nearby vehicles.
    \item \textbf{Key Features}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Vehicles change pseudonyms only when a certain number (\emph{k}) of neighboring nodes is reached.
        \item Operates with pre-equipped pseudonyms that are switched dynamically.
        \item The probability of tracking decreases as traffic density and speed variations increase.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Advantages}: Reduces location tracking probability in high-traffic areas, and improves performance compared to AMOEBA and Mix-Zone.
    \item \textbf{Challenges}: Optimal pseudonym change thresholds need to be determined dynamically.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Cybersecurity Issues and Countermeasures}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Fake Alerts}: False traffic alerts or CAMs can disrupt road operations. \textbf{Countermeasures}: Cryptographic authentication (e.g., ECDSA) to validate message legitimacy.
    \item \textbf{Data Theft}: Attackers can impersonate network nodes to capture sensitive packets. \textbf{Countermeasures}: Encryption and robust key management.
    \item \textbf{Unauthorized Profiling}: Misuse of personal data for profiling. \textbf{Countermeasures}: Pseudonymization to prevent linking identities to personal data.
    \item \textbf{Illusion Attacks}: False traffic warnings broadcast to create accidents or congestion. \textbf{Countermeasures}: Plausibility validation of messages.
    \item \textbf{Fake Identity \& Impersonation}: Adversaries impersonate legitimate vehicles for malicious activities. \textbf{Countermeasures}: ID-based cryptographic solutions to verify vehicle authenticity.
\end{enumerate}
