The rapid development of autonomous vehicles (AVs)
introduces transformative potential for modern transportation systems,
but it also raises critical concerns regarding cybersecurity.
As AVs increasingly rely on complexity, the attack surface for potential threats expands,
demanding robust and proactive security measures.
This survey aims to provide an overview of current research on security challenges in autonomous vehicles,
focusing on key cybersecurity threats, standards, and industry practices.
Emphasizing the need for a multi-layered approach to cybersecurity in AVs,
integrating secure software development, hardware resilience, and regulatory compliance is essential.
Moreover,
the survey explores future trends and emerging technologies that could enhance the security of autonomous vehicles helping the development of secure and reliable systems.
